1. Defining a SET
Syntax: set_name = { var1[, var2[, ...]] : < definition -> bool >}

2. SET Arithmatic
Other sets can be used when definining a new set. The following sections
define set arithmatic.

2.1. Inclusion
Within an expression:
Syntax (single element sets): e in set_name
Syntax (multiple element sets) : (e1,e2[,e3[,...]]) in set_name
Syntax (compound FOR ALL elements) = [e1, e2[, e3[, ...]]] in set_name

2. Inquiry
Using the same syntax for inclusion outside of a definition and followed by
a '?' will answer wether the element/s is included in the set. Most errors
will occurr at this stage, as it is the first time a set definition is
evaluated.

3. Predefined SETS
